# DeepLearning
a python deep learning algorithm that you can adapt to any project.

## To make a deep learning algorythme follow this steps : 
- Save the file <code>Algo.ipynb</code>.
- Install the necessary packages.
- Add your input and output matrices, containing binary numbers, attention the output matrix can only contain 1 value per input (0 or 1).
- Run the training code until you get the right result (if an error occurs, remember to transpose your matrices).
- Use your algorithm via the predict function in the <code>Testing</code> section.
